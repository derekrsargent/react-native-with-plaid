All implementations of Plaid created after July 23, 2020 use a `link_token` instead of a `public_key`. 

## How to run

yarn server
```

## Steps to create backend

Make backend directory with `mkdir backend`, change directories to it with `cd backend` and use command `yarn init`. 

Use the quickstart code for Node from [Plaid](https://github.com/plaid/quickstart/tree/master/node).
